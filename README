OVERVIEW

A command line program for demonstrating how to use the 
Gumstix Overo I2C-3 bus from a userland program. A Microchip 
MCP23017 I/O Expander is used as the slave device which
might be useful for some gumstix projects.

No attempt is made to explore all of the MCP23017 features.
See the datasheet if you want to know what else you can do 
with these devices. Just google MCP23017.

There is a diagram that shows how to wire things for this
program, including the logic level conversion you'll need.


PARTS

Logic Level Converter from Sparkfun : p/n BOB-08745, $1.95
I/O Expander from Digi-Key : p/n MCP23017-E/SP-ND, $1.44 


BUILDING

The makefile is intended to be run from a workstation that has
the OE cross-build environment already setup. If you've built
a gumstix image, then you should be good to go. If not, do that
first (or if you know better, then why are you even here ;-).   

If you have modified your build TMPDIR then make that change
to OETMP in the make file. 

After that, the makefile should just work.   


RUNNING

Copy the mcptest executable and run it. There are no arguments
and no options. It's just a simple how-to demo, it's not meant 
to be useful. 


FINAL

Let me know if something doesn't work. I tried to keep it as simple 
as possible. 

Hopefully, it saves you a little time on your first gumstix I2C 
project. 

Just trying to pay it forward.
